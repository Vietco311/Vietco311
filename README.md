## The name is Anthony Colin aka 'Vietco', nice to meet you! ðŸ‘‹
I'm currently a college student in the second year of my master's degree from the University of Corsica, an island situated South-East of France.
If you can propose me a good coding challenge, I'll gladly take it. I may not be the best, but I'll do my best to learn what's seems interesting!

### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...
About any language that could pick my interest actually.
But I've recently learnt about Multi-agents systems and currently trying to create a small village simulation on both free and learning time.  

**I already got formed on:**
- Python
- Object-Oriented Languages(Java, C#)
- Web languages(Most likely React)

### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...

[TrackMates](https://github.com/thomasGarau/TrackMates) : Educational application that combines artificial intelligence and cognitive sciences to offer customized learning methods. Python (Flask) and JavaScript (Node) backend + express, frontend in React JS.  
[MAS](https://github.com/Vietco311/Simulation-SMA-Unity) : A Multi-agents simulation on Unity made to learn.
